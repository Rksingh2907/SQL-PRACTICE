Tesla is investigating bottlenecks in their production, and they need your help to extract the relevant data. Write a query that determines which parts have begun the assembly process but are not yet finished.

Assumptions

Table parts_assembly contains all parts in production.
A part with no finish_date is an unfinished part.

parts_assembly Table
 _______________________
|Column Name	|Type     |
|-------------|---------|
|part	        |string   |  
|finish_date	|datetime |
|assembly_step|	integer |
|_____________|_________|

Solution:

SELECT DISTINCT part 
FROM parts_assembly
WHERE finish_date IS NULL;
