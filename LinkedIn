This is the same question as problem #8 in the SQL Chapter of Ace the Data Science Interview!

Assume you are given the table below that shows job postings for all companies on the LinkedIn platform. Write a query to get the number of companies that have posted duplicate job listings.

Clarification:

Duplicate job listings refer to two jobs at the same company with the same title and description.
job_listings Table:
 _____________________
|Column Name|	  Type  |
|-----------|---------|
|job_id	    |integer  |
|company_id	|integer  |
|title	    |string   |
|description|	string  |
|___________|_________|

Solution: 
Select count(r.company_id) FROM (SELECT company_id FROM job_listings
GROUP BY company_id, title HAVING COUNT(title)>1) as r;
